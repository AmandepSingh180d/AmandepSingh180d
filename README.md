# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Amandeep Singh

I'm a recent graduate from **UC Riverside** with a B.S. in **Computer Engineering**, passionate about embedded systems, control systems, and real-time hardware/software integration.

I'm looking for opportunities in **Embedded Systems**, **Controls Engineering**, or **Embedded Software Development**, and love building systems that bridge low-level hardware with high-level logic.
